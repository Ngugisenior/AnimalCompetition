This is a practice on creating classes and Objects
for this case we create an Animal tournament.
We will start by registering an Animal, it is necessary to give its name and birth year
this data cannot be changed during competition.
Each animal is scored and gets points for its Beauty and its Behaviour. To determine the resulting score the age of the animal is important.
Over a unified age limi their scoe will be zero, under this limit the score is computed.
Incase of a young animal the beauty is important, in the case of an older animal the behaviour is significant.
The formula is:
            **** score  =
